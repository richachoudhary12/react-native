<h2><b><u>Introduction</u></b></h2>

<p>

React Native is an open-source mobile application framework created by Facebook.<br>
It is used to develop applications for Android, iOS, Web and UWP by enabling developers to use React along with native platform capabilities.<br>

<h2><b><u>Usage</u></b></h2>

<p>

The fastest way to bootstrap a universal React Native project is with Create React Native App.<br>
Syntax:<br>
1. npx create-react-native-app

<h2><b><u>History</u></b></h2>

<p>

In 2012 Mark Zuckerberg commented, "The biggest mistake we made as a company was betting too much on HTML as opposed to native".<br>
He promised that Facebook would soon deliver a better mobile experience.<br>
Inside Facebook, Jordan Walke found a way to generate UI elements for iOS from a background JavaScript thread.<br>
They decided to organise an internal Hackathon to perfect this prototype in order to be able to build native apps with this technology.<br>
After months of development, Facebook released the first version for the React JavaScript Configuration in 2015.<br>
During a technical talk, Christopher Chedeau explained that Facebook was already using React Native in production for their Group App and their Ads Manager App.<br>

<h2><b><u>Implementation</u></b></h2>

<p>

The working principles of React Native are virtually identical to React except that React Native does not manipulate the DOM via the Virtual DOM.<br>
It runs in a background process (which interprets the JavaScript written by the developers) directly on the end-device and communicates with the native platform via a serialisation, asynchronous and batched Bridge.<br>
React components wrap existing native code and interact with native APIs via Reactâ€™s declarative UI paradigm and JavaScript.<br>
This enables native app development for whole new teams of developers, and can let existing native teams work much faster.<br>
React Native does not use HTML or CSS. Instead, messages from the JavaScript thread are used to manipulate native views.<br>
React Native also allows developers to write native code in languages such as Java for Android and Objective-C or Swift for iOS which make it even more flexible.<br>
